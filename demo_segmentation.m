function demo_segmentation
% Demo for mesh segmentation
% Reads from disk (./Data) meshes preprocessed into point clouds.
% Writes to disk (./Results) the resulting segmentation.

%%%%%%%%% SET PARAMETERS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 1) number of sampler iterations. Higher the better.
% Recommended setting > 150. Reasonable segmentations can often
% be achieved within the first 30 iterations. While these premature samples
% do not correspond to samples from the posterior distribution, they might 
% be sufficient to produce reasonable results. The segmentation quality
% gradually increases with increasing number of iterations.
NUMITER = 35; 
% 2) Select dataset to analyze
% We include two sets of meshes from the TOSCA dataset (Centaur and Horse).
% Each dataset consists of a single synthetic mesh in several different poses.
DATASET = 'Centaur'; % could also select 'Horse'
% 3) Noise parameter, this controls the amount of deviation from the
% predicted affine transformation.
% Noise --- HIGHER values will result in LARGER segments.
